<p>In this assignment you will work through problems from <a href="https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/phys139_239/README.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Javier Duarte's course page</a>.</p>
<p>If an assignment refers to a notebook or python file, this will be in Duarte's <a href="https://github.com/jmduarte/phys139_239" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repo</a>; see the GitHub button on the top right on Duarte's page. Although Duarte indicates point scores, we will grade your overall submission as Mastered/Resubmit like any other assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you encounter an unknown concept or function in the assignment -- look it up! For example, we might not cover k-fold cross-validation in class.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Python data science refresher. </strong>Choose one:
<ul>
<li><strong>If you don't need a refresher,&nbsp; link </strong>(or add to your submission) a python data science project that you completed earlier. Maybe from your Computational Physics course?</li>
<li><strong>If you do</strong>, work through <a href="https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/phys139_239/01a_Introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on 1a</a> and <a href="https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/phys139_239/01b_Debugging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on 1b</a>, and add the completed notebooks to your submission.&nbsp; (Read through the notebooks to make sure you understand the concepts, then do the little exercises at the end. There is one that requires a neighbor; you can skip the 'switch seats' part if there is none nearby.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tensorflow playground. </strong>Follow instructions from problem 4 in Duarte's&nbsp;<a href="https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/phys139_239/homework_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homework 1</a>. Write down your answers and include screenshots when necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Training curves for polynomial regression.&nbsp; </strong>Follow instructions from problem 2C-H in Duarte's <a href="https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/phys139_239/homework_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homework 1</a>.
<ul>
<li>Note: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve_(machine_learning)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning curve</a> can refer to the performance of a model vs <strong>size of the training data&nbsp;</strong>(for a converged fit), or the performance versus <strong>SGD iterations/epochs </strong>(on a fixed number of input datapoints). Duarte uses 'learning curve' in the first sense. In class we discussed learning curves in the second sense (which is a bit more common, I think).</li>
<li>A sustained increase in the training error with <em>epochs</em> is unusual and indicates some problem (e.g. too high learning rate.). However, a sustained increase in training error as you increase the amount of <em>training data</em> is <strong>quite normal</strong> if the test error is high. (Why?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stochastic gradient descent for linear regression. </strong>Follow instructions from problem 1 A-I in Duarte's <a href="https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/phys139_239/homework_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homework 2</a>. Note that you need to download some additional files.</li>
