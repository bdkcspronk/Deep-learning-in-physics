<p>In this assignment you will again work through problems from&nbsp;<a href="https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/phys139_239/README.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Javier Duarte's course page</a>.</p>
<p>If the homework refers to a notebook or python file that is not explicitly linked, it will be in Duarte's <a href="https://github.com/jmduarte/phys139_239" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repo</a>. Although Duarte indicates point scores, we will grade your overall submission as Mastered/Resubmit like any other assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose either:
<ul>
<li><strong>A.</strong> Read a <strong>git tutorial</strong>, then work through homework 3 problem 1 on basic usage of GitHub. Add a link to the repo you generated with your submission. (Duarte talks about "DataHub" -- replace that with CoLab or whatever other remote environment you'd like to use.)</li>
<li><strong>B</strong>. If you're already familiar with git, link to an existing Github/Gitlab/... repo that you have made contributions too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work through Duarte's <strong>hands-on 2 and 3</strong>. These show you how to use XGBoost and keras, which you'll need in the next exercise. The datasets are from particle physics detectors -- but for this week, it is not essential to understand all the features. Don't get lost in the sometimes very detailed descriptions of them.</li>
<li>Do A-E of&nbsp;<strong>homework 2 problem 2</strong>: Neural nets vs BDTs on the MiniBOONE dataset.<br><br>Exercise 4 below is optional. You can do it for learning, or to compensate for skipping some of the above subproblems if you don't find them useful.<br><br></li>
<li>(Optional). Add&nbsp;<strong>further refinements</strong> to the neural network in the last step of the previous exercise. Try and get the classification as good as you can. For example, consider batchnorm, layer initialization, dropout, wider/deeper nets, .... . If you can't find a significant improvement, just show the code and report on the result of a few experiments (I tried X because I thought/saw Y, result was Z).</li>
